Human Activity Data
==================================================
Data were summarized from the UCI machine learning repository Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set.(data downloaded from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
Training and testing data from the original dataset were combined into one. Only measurements of mean and standard deviation (measurements that contain “mean” or “std” anywhere the variable name) were extracted from original data set. 79 variables were extracted from the original 561 variables.
The average of each variable for each activity and each subject were calculated and included in the data set here.
==================================================

Data set includes the following variables:

1. Subject	Subject identification number
	1 - 30 represent the 30 subjects in the study

2. Activity	Activity type
		WALKING
		WALKING_UPSTAIRS
		WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
		SITTING
		STANDING
		LAYING

3. 79 accelerometer and gyroscope features. Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
	Only measurements of mean and standard deviation (measurements that contain “mean” or “std” anywhere the variable name) were extracted from original data set. 79 variables were extracted from the original 561 variables.
	The average of each variable for each activity and each subject were calculated and included in the data set here.

	Details about these measures are as follows:
	The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

	Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

	Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

	These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
	'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
